Better envisioned Stankova-Solution Morris-Thorne type of wormhole solution with a scalar potential conforming to Brans-Dicke theory with an anisotropic surface thin shell supported by
inovative Born-Infield Double Helix Electromagnetic Vortex.

Here is proposed a practical approach at realizing wormhole solution with a Well behaved Scalar Potential and Metric cheap energetically wise used in arangement with thin shell scalar surface of a meta material with
anisotropic but physically plausible properties supported by a Vortex field generator to reshape the properties of the scalar. The idea is that the EM field will act as a kick to introduce exotic energy properties
to a meta material shell surface to induce wormhole opening.

Although the Vortex Generator is purely speculative device there's nothing much novel in it than the simple aplication unit (The infamous "Sandanski Reotan"), a flat copper coil to recieve the signal from a
Radiofrequency induction amplifier and release it freely to a ferrite fanblade releasing it back trough the coil to give it proper vortexy shape. Eventually properly calibrated for the purpose and size of the
wormhole in mind a set of carefully arranged aplicators should in practice align the EM field with the help of controllers from the Radiofrequency Induction amplifier in the requirements needed, so when the
field crosses the meta material anisotropic thin shell it will exite it to produce properties otherwise appointed to exotic matter.

All the calculations provided have the purpose to show the viability of such arrangement with current tech. If not ideally a near future tech.
It's a mix of theories navigated trough towards a practical realization of such spatial defect.

This is a passion project. It's as feasable as all the rest official theories about wormholes and timeravel that also doesn't yet work.

If anyone actually make it work please give 10 points to Gryffindor!

There were another approach called Not-Petya
So this time let it goes as Much-Petya!
